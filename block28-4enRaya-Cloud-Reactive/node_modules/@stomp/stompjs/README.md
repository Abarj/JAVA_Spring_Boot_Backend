# STOMP.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stomp-js/stompjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stomp-js/stompjs)

This library provides a STOMP over WebSocket client for Web browser or node.js.
applications.

# Introduction

This repository is for version 5 and above of this library.
For version 3/4 of this library is maintained at https://github.com/stomp-js/stomp-websocket.

This library allows you to connect to a STOMP broker over WebSocket. This library
supports full STOMP specifications and all current protocol variants. Most
popular messaging brokers support STOMP and STOMP over WebSockets either natively
or using plugins.

In general JavaScript engines in browsers are not friendly to binary protocols,
so using STOMP is a good option because it is a text oriented protocol.

This library has its roots in a version released by [Jeff Mesnil](http://jmesnil.net/).

## Current Status

Version 5 of this library has been bottom up rewritten using TypeScript (versions 3/4
use CoffeeScript). The code has substantially changed, so, while there is a compatibility
mode, you might need to update your code.

This library is feature complete and has been used in production for many years. It
is actively maintained. You are welcome to file issues and submit pull requests.
